# Snake_in_C
this is a group project for creating the game snake on c in the terminal

SNAKE

this is our official snake game programmed in c using the curses library and much more. it features a colored simulation of the original snake game. Unlike the original, there is a top score players can reach in order to beat the game.

Game objective: A snake starts in the inner center of a rectangular border along with one drop of food place anywhere inside the space. The players task is to maneuver the snake towards the food to eat it without touching the border or the snake's tail. for each time you eat the food, the snake's tail grows longer and the snake gets faster. The player will have to keep going until they reach the top score.  

There are various sections that have been worked on in the game such as:

Border: the snake game will have a broder that would span from the outermost edges of the terminal - Erick

UI: the player will be met with a title screen that will disappear as the user presses enter -Erick

Game initilization: the game would be intitialized with the starting variables needed to start and reset the game, such as changing the snake length to its starting size or reseting the score - Erick 

Snake control: the user will be able to move the snake head around, with the snake body following behind it. If the snake hits the border, the game ends with a game over screen and a score recorded -Tyris

Snake collisions: the snake in the game will have collisions between the food, wall and the snake itself -Tyris

Food Placement: the food the snake eats to grow is plastered around the inner border where the snake can reach -Tyris

Score board: the game will keep track of the score of the current round as well as the highest score of the rounds the user played. There is also a top score that would finish the game if reached by the user. -Erick 

Game over screen: the game would show a game over screen explaining the reason of game over, the scores and if the player want to quit or continue -Tyris
