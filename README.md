# Snake_in_C
this is a group project for creating the game snake on c in the terminal

There are sections that have been worked on in the game such as:

Border: the snake game will have a broder that would span from the outermost edges of the terminal

UI: the player will be met with a title screen that will disappear as the user presses enter
